# J3RN's Vim Config

Just my personal vim config. I use it.

## Plugins
My descriptions below are very basic. Please read the projects' pages if you
would like to know more about them

- AutoSave - Saves your buffer every time it changes. Can be annoying, but
makes Vim more modern and Google Drive-esque
- NerdTree - A totally awesome tree viewing utility inside of Vim. Can be
triggered with CTRL-n
- Syntastic - Syntax checking. Pretty useful, I suppose
- Tmuxline - Make your Tmux freakin' beautiful
- Vim Airline - Make your Vim freakin' beautiful
- Coffeescript - Syntax highlighting for Coffescript
- Bundler - You can bundle from Vim with `:Bundle`. I used to use it, now Guard
does it for me
- Surround - Helps insert, modify, remove surroundings (parenthesis, quotes,
 etc). I don't fully understand it, but it's cool
- Endwise - Auto-inserts "end" for Ruby code
- Fugitive - The greatest Git wrapper ever written
- Git - Supports Fugitive for Vim versions < 7.2
- Markdown - Better Markdown support for Vim
- Rails - An epically beautiful Rails plugin for Vim. It's great
- Commentary - Quickly and easily comment out and in lines
- Slim - Slim support for Vim
- Auto Pairs - Auto-insert closing parenthesis, brackets, etc
- CTRL-P - Fast file searching
- Rainbow Parenthesis - Make different sets of parenthesis different colors (
for better understandability, obviously)
